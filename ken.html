  A visitor from another dimension! Martial Artist Ken has come to challenge his greatest foe. This Dark Warrior brings an extremely versatile skillset to any team, allowing for a very reliable Hero investment. The Coming of Asura (S3) offers an AoE Defense Break, while Knockout (S1) weakens the foe. If you happen to pull this extremely rare Hero, prepare to take on the world kicking and punching.

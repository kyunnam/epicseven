<strong>Overview</strong>
<p>
Apocalypse Ravi is a 5★ Dark Warrior that can be built as a tank or a bruiser. When fully built, she can become impossible to kill thanks to her passive War God's Might, and can kill squishy attackers in 1-2 hits. She is most commonly found in guild war offense and defense, and sometimes arena.

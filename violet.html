  <strong>Fast Riolet</strong>
  <p>
  Since Riolet is very taxing to gear, let's look at what will make him successful. He can be built 3 ways: speed, counter, lifesteal, all with different strengths and will change the way he is played.

  Given how he's played, players should look to build enough damage on him first and foremost, then fill out the build w/ speed or bulk, and then examine what type of teams he would fit on.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Stats</strong><br>
  The bottom line is that Riolet should be able to one shot a standard Martial Artist Ken at their respective level(players can use a damage calc. for that reference), which should be at least :
  Atk 3700
  CDmg 270

  If players can be at least 220 speed after that, they should opt to build a speed build that can pressure on his own without having to rely on the passive extra attack to be deadly.

  If players cannot reach at least 220 speed, they might want to opt for a counter or lifesteal, which can serve to make Riolet more unpredictable and thus increasingly harder to deal with without the need for speed.

  Any extra sub stats should go to flat defense to massively boost Riolet's resistance against chip damage when he evades. HP becomes secondary to defense since he's hard to one shot and can be healed back.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Sets</strong><br>
  I personally consider speed the strongest for players who can muster the stats since Riolet will have a presence similar to that of Assassin Coli, where he can pop a Charles, ML Ken, or even a hard counter like Dizzy or Falconer Kluri right as a fight starts, turning it into a complete 4v3.

  Without speed, players can opt for counter or lifesteal, which ever they prefer. Lifesteal will make Violet stickier and less dependent on support while counter can massively increase his kill potential and unpredictability on a defense team by speeding up his focus gain.

  As for a secondary set, due to Riolet being really stat hungry, a critical set is probably the best to round out the stats. An immunity set really isn't necessary since it only improves his matchup vs Dizzy, who doesn't rely on hitting to debuff.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Artifacts</strong><br>
  Moonlight Dreamblade is more consistent and better on slower builds but since Riolet self buffs with attack up, the buff becomes redundant. It is definitely the best build for counterattack sets.

  Violet Talisman has more value overall and only really works for really fast builds.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Skill Up</strong><br>
  Riolet is definitely a character the demands the +15, +10 at the very least.

  He needs Concentration maxed ASAP to maximize his survival.

  Massacre should be maxed as well for the damage but it should at least have the -1 cooldown.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Synergies</strong><br>
  Since he can self buff for attack, Riolet is ideally run with characters that support him defensively and characters that have AoE attacks that mitigate his lack of an AoE pressure.

  Aurius - Scales with his evasion to massively reduce damage take. Fallen Ceci, Krau, Lilias are the top candidate to support him this way. They each bring additional tools to support Riolet such as shield, def up, or extra attacks to charge his focus.

  Cleanse/Healing - will compensate for his low HP and vulnerability to characters such as Dizzy and other mages who can carry Iela Violin to dispel his evasion buff. Ruele, Diene, and Elena are all very good at supporting him this way.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Counters</strong><br>
  As of his release, Riolet has very few direct counters. But Riolet is most significantly countered by characters that can dispel buffs without relying on a hit or Dizzy, who debuffs on a miss.
  Falconer Kluri - the de facto counter on Riolet's release. Without attacking, she can dispel his evasion and defense break him, setting him up for an easy kill.

  Melissa - Dispels all buffs before attack, can land a 2 hit combo which for sure kills Riolet.

  Iela Violin - A very meta artifact to carry on a variety of mages.

  Dizzy - will still debuff Riolet on a miss but she will also miss him with her AoE attacks a lot, charging his focus, a double edged sword for sure.

  *Do note that a speed Violet will outspeed most meta builds for these characters and could very likely one shot them before they take a turn.
